## 👨🏾‍💻 About Me

Hey! I'm Alou — I love solving tough problems with code, especially when it comes to AI and data. I’m really into projects that combine math, intelligence, and practical usefulness. Right now, I’m focused on learning how machine learning models actually work, and how to build systems that are smart *and* helpful.

I’m a **Break Through Tech AI Fellow**, which means I’ve been learning how to build and evaluate ML models, work with teams, and think through real-world applications of AI. My favorite part? Seeing an idea turn into a working app.

## 🎯 Featured Project: StyleFit – Travel Outfit Recommender

**[🌤 StyleFit (Built at SEO Tech Developer)]([https://github.com/aloukone/StyleFit](https://github.com/mayokunl/Weather-Based-Outfit-Planner))**  
StyleFit is a travel outfit planning tool powered by GenAI and real-time weather data. It recommends what to wear and pack based on your destination, travel date, and preferences — plus it finds matching items through live product search.

- **Tools:** Python, Flask, OpenAI API, SerpAPI, Visual Crossing Weather API, Pandas, Bootstrap  
- **What We Did:** Combined multiple APIs to generate weather-aware outfit suggestions, surfaced matching clothing items via SerpAPI, and displayed everything in a clean, responsive UI  
- **Why It Matters:** StyleFit is all about personalization — it shows how AI and APIs can create smarter, context-aware recommendations

## 🚀 Other Projects

### 📊 S&P 500 Financial Analysis Project (Academic)  
Performed an in-depth analysis of S&P 500 company financials using Python to uncover relationships between stock price, earnings, volatility, and company size.

- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, SciPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib  
- **Highlights:**
  - Explored correlations (e.g., EPS ↔ Price, Market Cap ↔ Sector)
  - Ran linear regression and multiple hypothesis tests
  - Used K-Means clustering to identify 6 company financial profiles
  - Found that profitability significantly affects stock price relationships
  - Revealed that mega-cap firms tend to offer lower dividend yields despite strong earnings

## ⚡ Fun fact

I jump rope almost every day — it’s how I reset my brain. I'm the kind of person who will spend hours debugging something not because I have to, but because I *need* to understand it.
